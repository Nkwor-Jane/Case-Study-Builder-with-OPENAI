## About the project

This project was inspired by a blogpost about using OPENAI to build a Resume, scrolldown üëá to useful resources to get link to blogpost. I used it to build a case study assistant, you could input details about a case study.
It will be an AI generated case study. The information gotten can be used to assist people writing a case study.

Users should be able to:

- Input details about a case study
- Generate a case study
- Print the case study
- Download the case study
